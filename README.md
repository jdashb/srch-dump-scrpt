Welcome to SRCH-DUMP-SCRPT!  If you are reading this you have likely stumbled here by accident.  
This is a dumping ground for my file search&&dump scripts.  Depending on when you have come 
along, there may be very few, or many to choose from!  

Essentially this project exists to better my skills in combing through files with code; from
scripts that skim for dupes, make copies of different file types or crunch data from one file 
to the next.  

SRCH-DUMP-SCRPT is for me, but you are always free to copy and share.  I'm always down for
riveting discussion and broadening my knowledge, so give me a buzz anytime.
